# Linked_List

Program uses self-created string class that acts in place of original string class that is part of the C++ library. It reads words in from files to doubly linked lists, sorts the data, tracks objects created, tests copy constructor, and writes to files. 

Disclaimer: Although I created this solution, this project was not my original idea. It was a school project for Everett Community College related coursework.
